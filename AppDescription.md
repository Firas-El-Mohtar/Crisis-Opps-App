# Crisis-Opps-App

This app serves as an interface between various municipalities of Lebanon's Shouf region, Ain W Zein Hospital and Farah Social Foundation. The app has 4 unique types of users: 
Local Municipality User, Main Municipality User, Ain w Zein Hospital User and Farah Foundation User. Once the local municipality user is logged in, they can add 2 types of forms: PCR and
Homecare requests. Homecare forms require 2 images attached to the form: an ID scan, and a doctor's prescription. The municipality can also view the forms previously issued by 
this account ONLY, whereas other users can view all previously sent froms from all municipalities. PCR forms are managed by Ain w Zein only whereas Homecare forms are managed by all 3
other users. Once the Homecare form gets approved by Ain w Zein Hospital & Main Municipality, the form then appears on Farah Foundation's list of forms where they then decide its
fate and set an appointment. Upon setting an appintment, the user gets notified and is able to view the set appointment.
